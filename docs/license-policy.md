# License Policy

## Scope

This document defines the licensing transition policy for AgentMesh.

## Policy

- AgentMesh current and future repository development is licensed under Apache License 2.0.
- Published releases up to and including `v0.7.0` remain MIT as originally released.
- Existing published artifacts are not retroactively relicensed.

## Rationale

- Preserve permissive OSS adoption.
- Add explicit patent grant/retaliation language expected by enterprise legal reviews.
- Keep monetization in product and operational layers (managed services, enterprise policy packs, proof workflows), not in restrictive source licensing for core runtime code.

## Contributions

Contributions are accepted under the repository license and require DCO signoff (`git commit -s`).
